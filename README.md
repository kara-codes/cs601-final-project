# cs601-final-project
This is my final project for CS601, Introduction to Web Application Development. This website showcases the skills I've gained and refined while taking the course, including the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue to make an interactive website. The wesbite's purpose is to introduce the reader to me, the author/designer of the site. Some features of the site that I'd like to highlight are: limited us of red and green colors to increase accessibility, a photo gallery, and a short trivia quiz. The navigation bar is can be found in the upper left corner of each page on the website and can be used to browse the different pages. Cheers!
