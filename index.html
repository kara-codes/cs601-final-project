            <p class="about">
                I am a software test engineer and aspiring developer at <a href="https://www.biomerieux.com/us/en.html" target="_blank" class="bmx">bioMerieux</a>, where I have worked for the last five 
                years. Prior to joining the software team, I was employed as a systems engineer in charge of all non-product software validation for the project I work on. I worked closely with software engineers 
                to understand the applications they wrote and in the process developed an interest in software development; I decided to take a few online software courses, which I really enjoyed. 
                <br />
                In December of 2022 I joined the software team at work and in March of 2023 I started my first graduate course, studying software development via Boston University MET College's program.
                I have experience with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I have the most experience with writing C#.
                <br />
                I'm hoping to become a full-stack developer and/or architect someday. I love writing both UI and backend application code. 
                <br />
                <hr />
                <br />
                In my free time I enjoy hiking, playing video games, writing poetry, and baking. I live in Salt Lake City with my husband and two spoiled dogs.
